		<h2 class="section">RESTAURANT SUCCESS MODEL</h2>
		<p> There are more than 1 million restaurants in the U.S. employing about 10&nbsp;%  of the U.S. workforce. Given the large number of restaurants and how often they fail, I created a model that can provide insights to investors and lenders and help them evaluate restaurants based on whether they are likely to close within the next 4 years. For more details read the relevant <a href="https://medium.com/@alifier/using-yelp-data-to-predict-restaurant-closure-8aafa4f72ad6" target="_blank">blogpost</a> where I describe the process I followed to build this model and talk about my results. My code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/alifier/Restaurant_success_model" target="_blank">github</a>.

		<h2 class="section">A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NET THAT REMOVES LIPSTICK FROM IMAGES</h2>
		<p> An automated way of makeup removal would be useful to law enforcement or could be used as an added feature for dating apps. Here, I trained a convolutional neural net with an autoencoder architecture to remove lipstick from images of caucasian women. For more details check my <a href="https://github.com/alifier/MU_removal" target="_blank">github page</a>.

		<h2 class="section">FASTER IMAGE EDGE DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
		<p> Many of the microscopy images taken for scientific purposes (especially images of polymer particles) are not as complicated as real-life images (i.e. there is a presence of only two materials and a good contrast). The common edge detection algorithms (such as Canny) are "too good" for some scientific applications which means that the development of a simpler faster algorithm should be possible. I have developed an algorithm that creates a classification edge-detection dataset using the Canny edge detector. This dataset can then be used as input to train a machine learning algorithm to identify the edges of particles on similar images. This way the extraction of data from a large number of microscopy images becomes more feasible.<br><br> See an implementation example of this algorithm <a href="https://github.com/alifier/edgedetection" target="_blank">here</a> that yielded 98&nbsp;% pixel classification accuracy using linear logistic regression and only 0.5&nbsp;% of the information contained in one image. The number of required basic operations was cut in half compared to the Canny algorithm.

		<h2 class="section">CHOW FLEET (initially Princeton Deliveries)</h2>
		<p>I am currently working under the <a href="https://kellercenter.princeton.edu/elab/princeton-deliveries" target="_blank">Princeton University incubator program</a> to build "Chow Fleet". The company is delivering food from local restaurants that do not deliver to the Princeton campus in a lean experiment built to identify a scalable and repeatable business model for food delivery in low population density areas. <br><br>
